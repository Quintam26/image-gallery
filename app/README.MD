# Manro & Lonergan Image Gallery

This Web application is made to allow users to view, link, and upload images to our image database. Allowing for users to display Albums of images on the site.

## Getting Started

We have a package.json with a list of dependencies that need to be installed.
simply navigate to the file directory in your terminal or command line tool, and type 

npm i 

to install all necessary node packages.

After you get those you are ready to add albums, so navigate to the Add images component and begin adding images by typing into our container form the title, image source link, and a description. 

### Installing

1. Have a Github account to fork our repo

2. fork the repo, and clone it down.

3. npm i all dependencies.

4. launch the application using web-dev-server, you can do this by typing npm start and the web server will appear on port Localhost:8080.



## Running the tests

We used Jest to test our React application, We built up our reducers and actions using Test Driven Development (TDD) and used a green-red refactoring each test to first fail and then eventually pass.

Check our tests using our script npm test- which will run eslint as well as jest.


### And coding style tests

For our CSS we used CSS-Grid to format our components, and used media queries to change the layout to fit different screen-sizes.
